  - v0.1.0 (CURRENT)
   "Window classes, separation of header & source files, and multi-threading, oh my! (yeah, this is a big one)"
    + Added a changelog file
    + Separated source code from header files (SO INFURIATING!!)
      + Added licensing information to the top of each header/source file
    + Window class (a collection of Objects that contains an SDL_Window & SDL_Renderer inside
    + Functions to allow for multi-threaded Windowing if desired
      ~ The Window class itself doesn't have any multi-threading-specific code, meaning one could hypothetically
        implement a way to run multiple Windows without multi-threading if they so wanted
    + Replaced the rudimentary windowing system with a multi-threaded one
      + Event handling function replaced with event polling function
      + Added an event type specifically for creating new windows with this system
        ~ Has desired framerate as parameter to make use of condition_variables for optimization
    + Added GetTime() as a complement to GetSecs(); measures time since program start instead of current time
      + Replaced all instances of GetSecs() with GetTime() in the codebase
    + Added RenderEvents for Objects
    + Added mathematical transformation functions for SDL_Points, 2D Vectors, and 3D Vectors
    + Added RenderLine() for antialiasing support
      ~ Moved image/shape rendering function declarations to graphics/draw.hpp
    ~ Made the codebase more consistent with internal formatting rules
    ~ Changed certain filenames for convenience when sorted
    - Removed DEBUGGING flag & related code
    - Removed the useless Timer class
    - Removed unnecessary include files
